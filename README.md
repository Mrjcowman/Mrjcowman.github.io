## Description
This is my personal showcase to market myself to potential employers and clients alike. I will continue to iterate upon this site to ensure I always put my best foot forward.

## Credits
Thanks to the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) team for making the design of this mobile-friendly site simple.
